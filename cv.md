## About Me ##
I have been working as an accountant for more than 20 years. I already hold high positions in this area. Throughout my life I have been interested in programming. I was setting up accounting programs. Now, I am on maternity leave, I decided to try myself in programming and trained as a Web programmer at Tomsk State University. I didn't stop there and signed up for the RS School course "JavaScript/Front-end. Stage 0Â».  <br/>
I have the ability to learn and quickly assimilate new information. I would like to associate my further professional activity with programming.
